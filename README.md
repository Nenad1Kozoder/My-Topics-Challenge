# Word Cloud Challenge

## Description

This application displays a word cloud based on topics loaded from a JSON file. Each topicâ€™s font size is proportional to its volume, and color reflects the sentiment score:

- **Green**: sentimentScore > 60
- **Red**: sentimentScore < 40
- **Grey**: all others

Clicking on a word shows detailed sentiment breakdown (positive, neutral, negative) and total volume.

## Technologies Used

- React + TypeScript
- d3-cloud for word layout calculation
- CSS Modules + BEM for styling
- Vitest + React Testing Library for unit tests
